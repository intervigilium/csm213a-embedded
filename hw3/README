cs213-hw2-1 is part 1, which will output the capacitance in pF every 1 second
cs213-hw2-singleloop is part 2, written as a single loop that doesn't utilize
interrupts at all.
cs213-hw2-fgbg is part 2, written in foreground/background style, utilizing
interrupts to separate the foreground tasks from background.
cs213-hw2-protothread is part 2, written in protothread style, splitting up
the single loop version into various coroutines to handle serial input,
t0 and t1 sensor input.
All projects use a similar shared library for match checking.

The statecharts were done in LibreOffice Draw, and included in original ODG as
well as PDF form.
